# random-poker-hand-generator
Developed a random poker hand generator which is the test for my next project PokerTesterWindow. Coming to this project, when the program is run, it says "Welcome to the poker" game, generates a poker hand and asks the user if the player wants to play by giving Yes or No options.

I have made this project as part my coursework CS214 - Principles of Computer Science
