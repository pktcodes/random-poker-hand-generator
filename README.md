# random-poker-hand-generator
Developed a random poker hand generator which is the test for my next project PokerTesterWindow. Coming to this project, when the program is run, it says "Welcome to the poker" game. Initially, it randomly generates a poker hand and asks the user if the player wants to play by giving Yes or No options. The user can the random play until the the player choses "no" option.

I have made this project as part my coursework CS214 - Princples of Computer Science
